SP_MIRROR ROBUSTNESS AUDIT — FINAL REPORT
==================================================

Overfitting Risk Level: MEDIUM  (score: 3/10)

Key Findings:
  1. Walk-forward TE std = 3.29% — high variance across folds.
  2. Dynamic model does NOT justify its complexity (composite 11.42 > SP_mirror (regime) 10.57).

Composite Robustness Ranking:

  → Best: SP_mirror (regime)  (composite: 10.575)

Stability Verdict:
  Model shows some sensitivity — interpret results cautiously.
